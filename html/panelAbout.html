            <h1>CAF - Community Application Framework</h1>
            <p>CAF is a general library to create the frontend of web applications. 
               TODO: I seriously can't think of stuff to say...</p>
            
            
            <h1>Elements</h1>
            <p>CAF implements a set of different UI elements:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Panels</dt><dd>Panels are the placeholders for the application content. 
                    Navigation between panels is, by default, implemented in the top right corner.
                    CAF includes several panel classes that can get the content directly from the panel definition,
                    from a html element, from an html element in another file or using an iframe.</dd>
                <dt>Actions</dt><dd>Actions are user triggered operations which, by default, 
                    are available on the top left corner of the UI. Examples of actions are things like Save, Open, Log out...</dd>
                <dt>Notifications</dt><dd>These are messages that can be triggered by some another element. 
                    CAF implements a default notification type with success, info, warn, debug and error 
                    notification levels.</dd>
                <dt>Popups</dt><dd>The general popup interface implements functions to show, hide
                    and draw a popup. CAF includes more complex implementations like ok/cancel
                    popups or close popups.</dd>
                <dt>Templates</dt><dd>CAF templates define the general application layout, particularly where to draw actions and panels.</dd>
                <dt>Keybinds</dt><dd>With CAF keybinds, a combination of keys can be bound to a given operation. 
                    Particularly, they can be used to define a quick way of switching between panels.</dd>
                
            </dl>
