            <h1>Creating the application</h1>
            <p>A CAF application is created by calling the wd.caf.application constructor. 
               The specs for a new application include the name, the html container where the application will run,
               the template and the type of transition between panels. </p>
            
                <pre class="js">
var application = wd.caf.application({
    name: 'Community Application Framework', 
    container:"#caf", 
    template:'default', 
    transition: "basic"
});
                </pre>

            <h1>Elements</h1>
            <p>All CAF elements extend the same base class and share the same syntax for creation.
                TODO:</p>
            
            <p>Luckily, CAF already implements default classes for most of the UI elements and a 
               CAF application comes with those default elements registered. The exceptions are panels
               and actions, since they directly affect the layout. So, to create a new CAF application the first step is to 
               register panels and actions.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Panels</h2>
            <p>This sample panel is built using the pre-defined externalDivContent panel class, 
               which takes a DOM element from a given url and uses it as content for the registered panels. </p>
            
                <pre class="js">
application.getRegistry().registerPanel( wd.caf.impl.panels.externalDivContent({
    name:'about',
    description: 'About',
    order:"20", 
    url:"panelAbout.html", 
    selector:"#about"
}) ); 

                </pre>
            
            
            <h2>Actions</h2>
            
            <p>This sample action is registered using the same syntax as the panels. 
               The executeAction function triggers one of the registered notification messages. </p>
            
                <pre class="js">
application.getRegistry().registerAction(wd.caf.action({
    name: "notificationAction",
    description: "Notification action",
    order: 105,
    executeAction: function(){
        this.caf.notificationEngine.getNotification().success("Hello world")
    }
}) );

                </pre>
            
            <h2>Keybinds <span>[keybinds are optional but share the same syntax]</span></h2>
            <p>These sample keybinds use a pre-defined panelKeybind class, which triggers a transition to a given panel</p>
 
                <pre class="js">
application.getRegistry().registerKeybind(  wd.caf.impl.keybinds.panelKeybind({
    name:'about',
    key:'1'
}) );
                </pre>
            
            <h2>Others</h2>
           
            <p>If the other pre-defined elements are not enough, they can be extended with custom built classes.
               TODO: blah blah blah more talk here</p>
            
                        

            
            <h1>Launching the application</h1>
            
            <p>The init method starts the application.</p>
            
                <pre class="js">
$(function(){
    application.init();              
});
                </pre>
